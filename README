SAM9 - Atmel AT91SAM9 Stuff

This project is a bucket for my public SAM9 work.  I am working initially with
the at91sam9x25 chip, but this stuff should be helpful with other chips in the
same family.  Hope you can make use of it!

Do the following to get started and get some help information:

  make
  ./sam9boot

Also, this might be helpful:

  cat romboot-1.4-16nov2010.bin | hexdump -C
